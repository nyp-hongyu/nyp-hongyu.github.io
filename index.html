            <p>There's many kinds of drums you can play</p>
            <p>Though we will only cover the main ones, but if you want to know, your drum set can look like this</p>

                <div id="drumset-info">
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-snare">The snare drum is the most basic part of the drum, it is the
                        part you will learn to play first, starting with your single stroke rolls. It makes a crisp and
                        notable sound, caused by pressing many beads at the bottom of it via a wire that gets tightened
                        to press it up, somewhere between hitting sand, an empty metal pot, and paper. It also has a
                        switch at the side to "off" it which will take it back to sounding like the toms.</p>
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-high">The high tom produces a much higher pitched sound than any other
                        drum, like hitting an empty plastic bottle. Seen as much as the floor tom but less used as a
                        boom and more used for its nice sound.</p>
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-mid">Less seen compared to the high tom and floor tom, it's at the top
                        right and is really mostly used in drum fills and solos.</p>
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-floor">A commonly used drum in rock songs, pop songs, sometimes even
                        orchestral arrangements. Its big heavy bass sound meshes well when played together with a bass
                        kick drum.</p>
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-kick">The second drum one will be taught to play. Alternatively known
                        as the bass drum, the kick makes a loud boom when stepping on its pedal, as it forces a
                        hammer/mallet to whack the drum. It's used a lot alongside the snare and hi-hat in Rock songs
                        and way too much for Metal and
                        DnB songs.</p>
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-crash">Very well known. The crash cymbal is something you've
                        definitely heard before, it is THE cymbal. Placed usually at the beginning of sections or even
                        just bars, it has a fun splash to it that can be played with. Two crash cymbals can be found on
                        most drum sets.</p>
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-hihat">A simple yet vital cymbal, this is the third part a new drummer
                        will likely be taught. It has two parts, the pedal and the cymbal. Between closing and opening
                        the cymbal depending on if you step on the pedal, you will either get a nice tapping noise or
                        sticky metal that hits against each other, unless it opens too much, then you should probably
                        set the default height of it lower.</p>
                    <p class="info-drum" id="info-ride">Commonly used in jazzy, swingy songs, or sometimes blues, the
                        ride cymbal has a nice resounding echo to it even after a light hit. This is used like an
                        alternative hi-hat when you need a different vibe. Hitting the protrusion at the center will
                        cause it to produce a sound akin to a cow-bell.</p>

            <ul>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-single">The most basic technique. You simply go "Right, Left, Right,
                    Left,..",
                    hitting the drum normally with alternating hands. This is helpful when combined with other
                    techniques
                    just to practice them. Also do practice with this when getting used to higher speeds.</p><br>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-double">The Single Stroke Roll, but you alternate every 2 hits. Right
                    right,
                    left left. Also better when combined with other techniques but benefits quite a bit from learning to
                    play this consistently fast</p><br>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-ghost">Playing a Ghost Note on a drum is when you hit the drum much
                    lighter
                    and softer compared to normal. It shouldn't be completely silent, but just soft. It doesn't have to
                    be
                    barely audible either, as long as it is lighter and like a "ghost" compared to the other notes .</p>
                <br>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-flam">This is played with two sticks. Hold one like normal and the other
                    barely above the drum. Then, use both sticks to hit the drum. Since one is much lower than the
                    other, it will produce a ghost note, while the other is normal. This produces two hits in rapid
                    succession, with the first being just noticeable.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-drag">A bit more advanced than the flam, read that one first. You simply
                    do
                    your light hits twice before the normal stroke. Don't let the stick tap or bounce too much, only
                    two.
                </p><br>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-roll">A standard technique. Loosen your grip against your drumsticks so
                    that
                    they can freely pivot while you are holding them. You should be able to swing them just by flicking
                    your
                    wrist. When you can on both, make your stick drop down and bounce onto the snare before catching it,
                    most likely you performed a drag. A roll is simply throwing your hands down with that loose grip to
                    keep a steady flow of fast hits.</p><br>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-cross">Hold your drumstick, hands should be closer toward the bottom.
                    Fingers curling and ON the stick rather than wrapped around it. Then, rest your wrist against the
                    snare, press down your wrist while raising your fingers and the stick, before slamming your palm
                    down and making a clicking noise on the snare.</p><br>
                <p class="info-tech" id="info-rim">The trickiest technique in this catalog. It's simple to understand
                    but hard to execute, you need to hit the drum and the rim of said drum at the same time. To make it
                    easier, the drum should be hit with the head of the stick, the rounded tip. The neck, the conical
                    section of the stick should strike the rim.</p>
